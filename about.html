                Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines.
                It
                has become an essential part of the technology industry. The core problems of artificial
                intelligence
                include programming computers for certain traits such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Reasoning.</li>
                    <li>Problem Solving.</li>
                    <li>Perception.</li>
                    <li>Learning.</li>
                    <li>Planning.</li>
                    <li>Ability to manipulate and move objects.</li>
